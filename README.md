# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Project

### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to understand business performance, customer behavior, and sales trends.  
The analysis combines SQL-based exploration with data visualization using Power BI to deliver meaningful insights that support data-driven decision making.

### 🗄️ Database Setup
* Created a SQL Server database named **Pizza Project**
* Imported raw sales data from CSV files into the database
* Performed initial data exploration to understand the structure and quality of the data

### 📊 Data Analysis Approach
Two main types of analysis were conducted using SQL queries:

### 1️⃣ Descriptive Analysis
* Calculated core KPIs such as total revenue, total orders, total pizzas sold, and average order value
* Analyzed pizza performance by category, size, and name
* Identified top-selling and low-performing pizzas

### 2️⃣ Time Series Analysis
* Analyzed monthly and daily sales trends
* Monitored the number of orders and total revenue over time
* Measured growth and decline in sales across different months
* Tracked pizza prices over time across different sizes to check price stability
* Used window functions to compare performance over time

### 📈 Data Visualization (Power BI)
* Connected Power BI to the database
* Checked data quality and consistency
* Performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
* Built an interactive dashboard to visualize KPIs, trends, and insights
